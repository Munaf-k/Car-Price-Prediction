Project Structure
app.py: This is the main script that defines the Flask application. It loads a pre-trained machine learning model (random_forest_regression_model.pkl) and handles the routing for the web application.

index.html: The HTML template for the web interface. It includes a form where users can input details about the car, and the predicted selling price is displayed on submission.
